> Scrums.com's shareable [**semantic-release**](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) configuration

## Plugins

This [shareable configuration](https://github.com/sovtech/semantic-release-config/blob/master/.releaserc.json) uses the following plugins:

- [`@semantic-release/commit-analyzer`](https://github.com/semantic-release/commit-analyzer)
- [`@semantic-release/release-notes-generator`](https://github.com/semantic-release/release-notes-generator)
- [`@semantic-release/npm`](https://github.com/semantic-release/npm)
- [`@semantic-release/git`](https://github.com/semantic-release/git)
- [`semantic-release-slack-bot`](https://github.com/juliuscc/semantic-release-slack-bot)

## Summary

- Provides an informative [git](https://github.com/semantic-release/git) commit message for the release commit that does not trigger continuous integration and conforms to the [conventional commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (e.g., "chore(release): 1.2.3 [skip ci]\n\nnotes").
- Commits the version change in `package.json`.
- Creates or updates a [changelog](https://github.com/semantic-release/changelog) file.
- Posts updates from above changelog to a slack channel.

```bash
$ yarn add -D semantic-release @scrumsdotcom/semantic-release-config
```

With npm:

## Usage

The shareable config can be configured in the [**semantic-release** configuration file](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/usage/configuration.md#configuration):

Preferred via `.releaserc` file:

```json
{
  "extends": "@scrumsdotcom/semantic-release-config"
}
```

Or via `release` key in the project's `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "release": {
    "extends": "@scrumsdotcom/semantic-release-config"
  }
}
```

## Configuration

Setup the Semantic Release slackbot integration on your Slack's workspace. [Setup Guide](https://github.com/juliuscc/semantic-release-slack-bot#configuration)

Ensure that your CI configuration has the following **_secret_** environment variables set:

- `SLACK_WEBHOOK`: Slack webhook created when adding app to workspace.
- `SEMANTIC_RELEASE_PACKAGE`: Override or add package name instead of npm package name.

See each [plugins](#plugins) documentation for required installation and configuration steps.
